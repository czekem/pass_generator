PyPassword Generator

PyPassword is a simple password generator that creates strong and secure passwords. It allows you to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers that you want in your password. The generated password is then shuffled to increase its security.
Usage

To use PyPassword, simply run the script and follow the prompts. You will be asked to enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers that you want in your password. The generated password will then be displayed.
Example

$ python pypassword.py

    How many symbols would you like?
    5
    How many numbers would you like?
    5

Security

PyPassword uses random.shuffle() to shuffle the characters in the generated password. This makes it more difficult for attackers to guess your password by brute force.
