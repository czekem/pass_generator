   This script generates strong and difficult-to-crack passwords. It primarily relies on the 'random' library to generate random password elements.
The user is prompted to specify the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for their password.
After the user provides input, the program generates a strong random password that meets their requirements. 
To enhance security, the password is shuffled to make it more difficult to guess or crack.
